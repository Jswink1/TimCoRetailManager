# TimCo Retail Manager

This application simulates a retail management application which consists of an API that serves product and user data, and a WPF front-end that acts as a sales register.
The application is initially written in .NET Framework, and then upgraded to .NET Core.

Concepts that I have learned and implemented into this project are:

- .Net Framework APIs and WPF projects
- Upgrading from .Net Framework to .Net Core
- Setting up Swagger in a .Net Framework API
- Entity Framework
- ASP.NET Identity
- Authentication Tokens
- SQL Data Access using Dapper
- Stored Procedures
- SQL Transactions
